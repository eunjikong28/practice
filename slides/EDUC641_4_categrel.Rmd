# Reminder of motivating question


.blue[**Were convicted murderers more likely to be sentenced to death in Georgia if they killed someone Black or if they killed someone white?**]

---
# Materials

### 1. Death penalty data (in file called deathpenalty.csv)
### 2. Codebook describing the contents of said data
### 3. R script to conduct the data analytic tasks of the unit

---
# What we've done

```{r, echo= F}
df <- read.csv(here("data/deathpenalty.csv"))
df$rvictim <- factor(df$rvictim,
                      levels = c(1,2), labels=c("Black", "White"))
df$rdefend <- factor(df$rdefend,
                      levels = c(1,2), labels=c("Black", "White"))
df$deathpen <- factor(df$deathpen, 
                      levels = c(0,1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))

```

```{r, echo=T}

#### Can ask R for this too:
```{r, echo=T}

# Grouped charts
We can visualize these counts:

ggplot(df, aes(x = rvictim,
               fill = deathpen)) +
        geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
        xlab("Race of victim") +
        theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +
        scale_fill_discrete(name = "Death sentence?")
```

---
# What is "related"?

To answer whether *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM* are related in our observed sample...

--

it might be helpful to imagine what the proportion of defendants sentenced to death would look like **if there were NO relationship**

*Note*: The proportions above are rounded, so if you use them to calculate the **EXPECTED** values, they will differ slightly from those on the next slide. If you calculate the proportions by hand (i.e., $1506/2474 = 0.60\overline{84}$), you will get the exact values, and then they will align with the rounded **EXPECTED** values on the next slide.

# The Chi-Squared $\chi^2$ statistic

We can summarize the **NET DISCREPANCY** between the tables of **OBSERVED** and **EXPECTED** frequencies, using a statistic called the Pearson Chi-Squared ( $\chi^2$) statistic

$$ \chi^2 = 103.8 $$
--

Decision rule: If $\chi^2$ is big, then declare that there is a relationship between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM*; if $\chi^2$ is zero (or close), then declare there is no relationship between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM*...

--
but what is **BIG**, what is **close to zero**, and is 103.8 **big** or **close to zero**?

--

For that we will use the this statistic to conduct a $\color{red}{\chi^2}$ .red[**goodness-of-fit**] test.

# Statistical inference

Let's take a step back to capture the nature of the problem
- We've looked at some data on some convicted murderers in the state of Georgia
- We're not interested in only *these* murderers, but we're interested in a broader *population* of murderers from which our *sample* was drawn
  + In fact, even if we could observe outcomes for all murderers in the state of Georgia, our observation of them is imperfect due to *measurement error* and so we only ever observe samples, never populations (more on this later)
- Is there something about sampling from a population that could resolve our problem?
- Is there some way to generalize our conclusions about our *sample* relationship between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM* to the *underlying population*?
  + This is called *statistical inference* and it is *the* critical contribution of quantitative methods to research

---
# Sampling idiosyncrasy

#### When you generalize from a sample back to its underlying population, you must be careful that your empirical study has not been the victim of *sampling idiosyncrasy*

#### Is the following scenario plausible?
- There really is no relationship between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM* **in the population**
- By accident, we have drawn an idiosyncratic sample from the population
- This sampling idiosyncrasy ended up giving us a $\chi^2$ statistic as large as 103.8 by pure accident

#### How can we assess the plausibility of this scenario? 

---
# The Null Hypothesis $(H_{0})$

We start by imagining a hypothetical world in which there is **no relationship** between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM* in a true population of convicted murderers. Then, we imagine drawing a series of samples of convicted murders over and over again (say...10,000 times) from this hypothetical population. What values of the $\chi^2$ statistic might we observe?

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=F}
  include_graphics("null_pop.jpg")
```

---
# Testing the null

In this hypothetical example of repeated sampling from a null population, we could record all 10,000 values of the $\chi^2$ statistic
```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5.25}
set.seed(123456)
chsq <- data.frame(Chi_Square=rchisq(1:10000, df=1))
ch <- ggplot(chsq, aes(Chi_Square)) + geom_histogram() +
            theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
ch
```

The histogram summarizes the natural variation that could occur in a $\chi^2$ statistic as a result of *random sampling idiosyncrasy*, after drawing repeated samples from a hypothetical population in which there is no relationship between *DEATHPEN* and *RVICTIM*.

---
# Testing the null

In this hypothetical example of repeated sampling from a null population, we could record all 10,000 values of the $\chi^2$ statistic
```{r, echo=F, fig.height=5.25}
ch + geom_vline(xintercept = 5, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size=1.5)
```

.blue[*If this were the histogram that could result from sampling idiosyncrasy, and this were the value of the chi-square statistic, what would you think?*]

---
# Testing the null

In fact, this is the value of the $\chi^2$ statistic we observed:
```{r, echo=F, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(chsq, aes(Chi_Square)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 103.8,  color = "red", size=1.5) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

--

.blue[*This is a histogram of possible chi-square values that could result from sampling idiosyncrasy, and then the actual value of the chi-squared statistic in our sample. What do you think?*]

--

*WOOHOO!* In this thought exercise, you've just engaged in a rudimentary version of .red[*Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)*]; the bedrock of most social science research.

---
# Testing the null (*p*-values)

In fact, we don't need to examine the full histogram. Instead, we can say that in a hypothetical exercise of sampling repeatedly from a null population, less than 1 in a 1,000,000,000,000,000 (trillion) of all accidental values of the $\chi^2$ statistic are larger than a value of 103.8

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(chsq, aes(Chi_Square)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 103.8,  color = "red", size=1.5) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

--

The statistic that captures the probability of observing a $\chi^2$ statistic of a given magnitude in a particular sample, in the presence of a null population, is called the .red[*p*-value]

# Putting it all together

### Basic steps of classical statistical inference
1. State a research question, including a null hypothesis $(H_{0})$ which states there exists no relationship between our variables of interest
2. Display and describe the observed data
3. Summarize the observed data in relationship to an expected value
4. Set a threshold at which we will no longer believe that the discrepancy between the observed and expected relationship is due to sampling idiosyncrasy
5. Estimate the *p*-value
6. Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis
7. Interpret your findings drawing explicitly on plots, summary statistics and test statistics

# Our intepretation

> In the population of convicted murderers in Georgia, the imposition of the death penalty and the race of the victim are related ( $\chi^2$ = 103.8, *p*< 0.001) The percentage of convicted murderers who were sentenced to death after killing a White victim was more than 8 times the percentage of convicted to murderers who were sentenced to death after killing a Black victim. In Figure 1, we show... 

> This phenomenon is largely driven by the imposition of the death penalty on Black defendants. Courts sentenced Black defendants to death for killing White victims at more than 32 times the frequency than when they were convicted of killing Black defendants ( $\chi^2$ = 414.7, *p*<0.001); whereas, we detect no statistical difference between White defendants convicted of murdering White compared to Black victims ( $\chi^2$ = 3.3, *p*=0.067). In Table 1, we show...
