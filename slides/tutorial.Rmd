# Terminologies

 * [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free and open-source programming language, created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
 
 * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, serving as an interface to R.
 
  + It includes a console (a code editor that supports direct code execution) and numerous tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.
  
  + It has two versions: RStudio desktop (the software we'll be using in our computer) and RStudio server (RStudio access using a web browser)
